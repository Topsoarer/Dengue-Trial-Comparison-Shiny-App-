## Description

This application is designed to help researchers and epidemiologists explore and compare the efficiency of different clinical trial designs. Users can adjust a range of antibody-based and infection-based parameters—such as mosquito biting rates, antibody dynamics, and intervention effectiveness—to simulate trial outcomes and estimate required sample sizes.

The tool provides a dynamic interface to visualize the impact of these parameters on key metrics, allowing for a more informed decision-making process when planning costly and complex clinical trials.

## Features

- **Parametric Simulation**: Flexibly adjust over 15 key parameters to customize simulation scenarios.
- **Dual Trial Models**: Simultaneously simulate both MSP antibody-based trials and infection-based trials.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Dynamically generates a variety of plots, including biting rates, antibody titer trajectories, infection hazards, and sample size requirements.
- **Scenario Recording**: Save, view, and compare multiple parameter configurations and their resulting outcomes in a clear, interactive table.
